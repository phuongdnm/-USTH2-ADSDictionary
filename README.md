## Tool and libraries we used:
* **Java version 8**.
* **JavaFX and SceneBuilder**. 
  *  JavaFX is already in JDK 8. If you use the lastest version of Java (9,10,11), you must download JavaFX and install it yourself. You can follow this [**link**](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
  *  SceneBuilder: an awesome app to build your UI code. You can download [**here**](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/). I highly recommend you to check out the tutorial of [**thenewboston**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLkOX4Eez6o&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBzfXLWLSYVy8EbTdpGbUIG).
 * [**ControlsFX**](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) and [**JFoenix**](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix). Special thanks to all the developers that contribute to those libraries.
 * Google, Youtube and Stack Overflow :))
